## Description

This open-source project is a partially complete ODBC driver for the
[Trino distributed SQL engine](https://trino.io/). It implements the
essential portions of the ODBC core specification required to enable
Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerBI Desktop to connect to and
execute queries against a Trino server. Four authentication methods
are supported: no authentication, External Authentication, the OIDC
Client Credential flow, and the OIDC Device Authorization (Device
Flow) grant.
The driver was developed to address a narrow gap in connectivity
options for these tools on the Windows operating system within
the Open Source Trino community.

Note: this project is not sponsored by or affiliated with
Microsoft in any way.

### :warning: Disclaimer: Scope and Limitations :warning:

This driver is tested to work within a very narrow scope on Windows
PCs and servers that utilize BI tools. Specifically, we target
compatibility with Microsoft Excel and PowerBI Desktop with External
Authentication, Client Credential Auth, and Device Flow. Other tools,
forms of authentication, and functionality of the ODBC specification
were left unimplemented if not required by these tools. Functionality on
external systems or configurations may vary, and compatibility is
not guaranteed.  For users needing cross-platform compatibility or
full ODBC specification support, you should consider a feature-complete
commercially available ODBC driver for Trino.

### Alternatives and Performance Considerations

For PowerBI users, there is also the
[Trino PowerBI Connector](https://github.com/CreativeDataEU/PowerBITrinoConnector)
project, which works well for many use cases. In our experience,
it was found to exhibit slow loading performance on datasets contaning
hundreds of millions of rows of data. This appears to be
a limitation in the performance of the Microsoft Power Query
language, and is not a reflection on the quality of work
in the PowerBITrinoConnector project, which is fantastic!

### Contributing

Please see [our Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

### Known Limitations

- Only compiled for Microsoft Windows
- Only supports reading data, not writing/transacting data.
- Does not support most forms of Trino authentication including password authentication
- Does not support the ODBC wide-char unicode encoding (UCS-2 format, 16-bit characters)
- Supports prepared statements (SQLPrepare, SQLExecute, SQLBindParameter) only
  in a limited form. See the "Prepared Statements and Parameters" section below
  for what is and is not supported.
- Does not support ODBC conformance Level 1 or Level 2
  - [About Conformance Levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/develop-app/interface-conformance-levels)
  - It does not __completely__ support the Core conformance level, but is close.
- Does not support SQL Transactions. SQLEndTran is implemented as a no-op that
  reports success; the Trino transaction headers are not handled.
- Does not support binding and fetching multiple rows in a single call (SQLFetch with array size greater than 1)
- Does not support non-sequential data fetching (SQLFetchScroll/SQLExtendedFetch)
- Does not support iteratively discovering and enumerating connection attributes (SQLBrowseConnect)
- All columns are reported as being nullable, regardless of whether they are
  actually nullable or not.

There are many more limitations not mentioned here. The ODBC specification
is quite large and it's very difficult to tell what ODBC features a
given application will require by reading the spec. None of the above
features are required for Microsoft PowerBI Desktop or Microsoft Excel to
use the driver to read data from Trino using Client Credential Auth,
External Authentication, or Device Flow.


### Prepared Statements and Parameters

The driver implements prepared statements by mapping them onto Trino's
own `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` SQL statements. `SQLPrepare` submits a
`PREPARE <generated name> FROM <your query>` statement to Trino and polls
until Trino reports the statement as prepared. `SQLBindParameter` records
the bound application buffer in the statement's parameter descriptor.
`SQLExecute` then builds an `EXECUTE "<generated name>" USING ...`
statement, rendering each bound parameter as a SQL literal.

What this means in practice:

- Parameters are interpolated into SQL text as literals by the driver,
  not sent to Trino as separate parameter values. Strings are single-quoted
  with embedded single quotes doubled.
- Only input parameters are handled. The `InputOutputType` argument to
  `SQLBindParameter` is logged but otherwise ignored, so output and
  input/output parameters do not work.
- Supported parameter C types are `SQL_C_CHAR`, `SQL_C_FLOAT`,
  `SQL_C_DOUBLE`, `SQL_C_BIT`, the signed/unsigned tinyint, short, long,
  and bigint types, `SQL_C_DATE`, `SQL_C_TIME`, and `SQL_C_TIMESTAMP`.
  Any other C type causes `SQLExecute` to fail with `SQL_ERROR`.
- Null parameters are not supported. `StrLen_or_IndPtr` is stored but is
  not inspected when rendering the parameter, so `SQL_NULL_DATA` is not
  honored.
- `SQLNumParams`, `SQLParamData`, and `SQLPutData` are present but return
  `SQL_ERROR`, so data-at-execution parameters do not work.
- `SQLDescribeParam` is not implemented.


### Identifying Specific Limitations

The best way to find what if anything is missing is to give it a try!
This is relatively easy to do.

1. Install this driver.
1. Configure a DSN for this driver and enable trace-level logging in the DSN config.
1. Enable tracing in the driver manager as well.
1. Trigger an error when your application tries to use this driver.
1. Review any error dialog boxes from the application, if they appear
1. Review the driver logs (C:\temp\odbclog.txt) for the word "error"
1. Review the ODBC Driver manager trace logs for the word "error"


From here, you'll often find precisely what features were required
but were not yet implemented. Once you know what's missing, a review
of the the ODBC specification's documentation typically explains
what the missing functionality accomplishes. From there, it's
just a matter of writing the code to enable it.


## Developer Prerequisites

We recommend using Visual Studio Community (Not VSCode) for developing
this project. Even in a commercial organization, Visual Studio Community
is free to use for contributing to open source projects such as this one:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.

This ODBC driver makes use of the vcpkg tool for CMake. Follow the instructions
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd)
to set it up. `vcpkg.json` declares the dependencies that vcpkg will acquire:
libcurl (with the openssl feature), nlohmann-json, and googletest.

The driver is built as C++20 and uses `std::format`, so a toolchain with
C++20 library support is required. `CMakePresets.json` defines four presets,
which are the configurations this project is built and tested against:

* `x64-debug`
* `x64-release`
* `x86-debug`
* `x86-release`

Debug configurations compile with the `DEBUG` preprocessor definition, which
the test suite uses to pick which DSN to connect to. See "Testing and
Debugging" below.

The installer package makes use of WiX. Installation and configuration of WiX is
described in the "Installing" section below.

## About the ODBC paradigm

Most applications that use ODBC do so through a driver manager rather than interacting
directly with the driver. The driver manager is provided by the operating system or
an operating system package (like UnixODBC). The driver manager intercepts calls
from an application to execute queries, read data, describe columns, or otherwise.
Then the driver manager, with knowledge of the actual capabilties of any given
driver, translates those calls into the appropriate function calls for the
driver. It functions as a kind of normalizing intermediary. This allows
application writers not to need to understand the differences between the ODBC 2,
3.0, 3.5, and 3.8 specs to use an ODBC driver. They simply call the functions
they want to use, and either the driver implements enough to do it or it does not.

In order to enable this functionality in the driver, the driver's author must
supply information about the driver's capabilities to the driver manager. This
is done by implementing a pair of functions. The first is `SQLGetInfo`, which
provides a variety of information about the driver and its capabilities. One
of the things the driver manager can request from `SQLGetInfo` is the
`SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER`, which allows the driver manager to infer what level of
capabilities should be present in the driver. The second critical function
is `SQLGetFunctions`, which provides information to the driver manager
about the specific set of functions that are available from the driver.
Not every driver implements every single function in the ODBC spec, and
this driver is no exception. `SQLGetFunctions` provides a way for the
driver manager to ask if a given function is supported or not.

## Testing and Debugging

The best way to test the driver is to install the build output DLL as
the driver for your system. ODBC drivers are installed entirely by
manipulating the Windows Registry. Set the keys as described in
`install/RegisterTrinoODBC.reg`, but substituting the path to the
TrinoODBC.dll file generated in the build output directory. Once this
is done, you should see TrinoODBC show up in your ODBC Data Sources
window (for both 32 and 64 bit). Every time you build this tool,
the system driver is effectively updated because it points to
the build output. This makes for a rapid code -> build -> test
loop. Note that these registry keys are the same ones used by
the installed release driver, so following this process will replace
the driver installed in your system with the driver built by compiling
this code.

The recommended approach to testing the driver's code is to create separate
driver installations (by editing install/RegisterTrinoODBC.reg) pointing
to debug and release builds of the driver. Name the drivers `TrinoODBCDebug`
and `TrinoODBCRelease`. Then, create separate DSNs targeting those drivers
named  `TrinoTestDebug` and `TrinoTestRelease`. The test executable is
already configured to select between DSNs with those two names based on
the presence of the `DEBUG` preprocessor definition, meaning your tests
will automatically target the correct driver based on your build
configuration.

To get started, the easiest thing to do is to pick a processor
bitness and stick with it until your feature is developed. If you decide
to test both x64 and x86 builds, make sure the Driver/DSN you are testing
has a bitness that matches the test suite you wish to run. It's very easy
to get this mixed up and test the wrong driver, since the ODBC Driver Manager
is unaware that it's being used in a test suite and should target a specific
build output unless explicitly configured to do so.

The test suite assumes this DSN is configured for a vanilla
trino instance. Running a standalone copy of the
[Trino Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/trinodb/trino)
provides a trino instance that is sufficient to run the suite.

Once you have a driver and DSN installed and configured,
run the `TestDriver.exe` executable to run the full test suite
for this driver.


## Installing a Windows ODBC Driver

There are three ways to install this driver.

1. Using a pre-built and released MSI installer (See Releases Page)
2. Compiling your own driver and building your own MSI installer for it.
3. Manual driver compilation and installation.

### Using a pre-built MSI installer

See the releases page for the most recent release of this driver. Each release
publishes a 64-bit and a 32-bit installer named for that version, such as
`TrinoODBC_x64_1.4.0.msi`, along with a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file listing the hash
of each installer.

To confirm a download arrived intact, run
`Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\TrinoODBC_x64_1.4.0.msi` in PowerShell and
compare the hash it prints against the matching line in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
PowerShell prints the hash in upper case and `SHA256SUMS.txt` records it in
lower case, so compare the two without regard to case.

### Building your own MSI installer

This project uses [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/) to build an installer package for
this driver.

1. We recommend using the .NET SDK to install WiX on your system. If developing in
   Visual Studio the .NET SDK is an optional installation option.
   You can re-run the installer and select "Modify" if you didn't select this the
   first time.
    1. If you want to manually install the .NET SDK, visit
       https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk
1. If you haven't already done so, configure a nuget package source for the
   .NET SDK. Instructions for Visual Studio:
    1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69045231/nuget-package-sources-missing
1. Begin by installing the WiX tool on your system using the .NET SDK.
    1. Run `dotnet tool install --global wix --version 5.0.2`
1. Add the WiX UI extension.
    1. `wix extension add -g WixToolset.UI.wixext/5.0.2`
1. Build the installer
    1. `cd install`
    1. `./build_x64_installer.ps1` (for a 64-bit installer)
    1. `./build_x86_installer.ps1` (for a 32-bit installer)
1. The finished installer will appear, ready to be used. The filename carries
   the version, so a locally built 64-bit installer is named for whatever
   version was built, such as `TrinoODBC_x64_0.0.8.msi`. Builds that do not
   come from the release workflow use the default version in `CMakeLists.txt`,
   which is the next version expected to be released. Pass `-Version` to the
   script if you need a specific version instead.
